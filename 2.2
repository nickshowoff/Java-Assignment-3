2.2 (Compute the volume of a cylinder) Write a program that reads in the radius and
length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:
area = radius * radius *
volume = area * length
Here is a sample run:

Enter the radius and length of a cylinder:
The area is 95.0331
The volume is 1140.4

import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter the radius and length of a cylinder:");

  double radius = input.nextDouble();
  double length = input.nextDouble();
  double area = radius * radius * 3.14159265;
  double volume = area * length;

  System.out.println("The area is " + area);
  System.out.println("The volume is " + volume);    

 } 
}
